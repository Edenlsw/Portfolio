            <summary class="description"> My name is Eden Lindy Smith-Wint, welcome to my portfolio. 
                <br>
                I am currently enrolled on the BlackCodHer Bootcamp, the first of its kind in Birmingham.<br>
                Currently I work for the Civil Service but hopefully at the end of the 6-month course I will be able to successfully complete a career change into tech by becoming a Software Developer/Engineer.
                I have a background in Graphic Design and I hope that will somewhat help me with my 
                transition into the tech world.  Due to background with Graphic Design I think I  wanted to enter into Front-End Development however I am 100% open and interested to learn about many of the other tech areas.
